# Open Clustertruck Timer
Clustertruck automated neural network timing for speedrunning. This chrome extension is primarily to be used by moderators and runners who want to time their own runs.

## Credits
Thank you for [Noahkra](https://github.com/noahkra) for providing the initial code and information on how to set up the neural network working. Without Noah's research and efforts this would not have been possible.
This is using brains.js for the neural network
